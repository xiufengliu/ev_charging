Static charging infrastructures, designed for public use, are ill-suited to cope with the high variability of production schedules and fleet operations, leading to costly downtime and inefficient energy use. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin (DT) framework for the design and real-time operation of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems as reconfigurable manufacturing systems. The framework integrates a discrete-event simulation model of the manufacturing environment with a mathematical optimization-based control system. The DT controller solves a rolling-horizon optimization problem to generate predictive, optimal charging schedules that co-optimize energy costs and vehicle availability, while respecting both grid-level and operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a detailed simulation study of a representative job-shop manufacturing facility. The results show that our DT-based approach reduces total energy costs by X\% and improves vehicle uptime by Y\% compared to standard baseline charging strategies (e.g., first-come-first-served and charge-when-low). This work provides a new paradigm for integrating EV charging infrastructure as a dynamically controlled, intelligent component of a smart manufacturing ecosystem.\end{abstract}\section{Introduction}% - Motivation: Electrification of industrial fleets (AGVs, forklifts).% - Problem: Existing charging solutions are static and inefficient for dynamic manufacturing environments.% - Gap: Lack of a holistic framework that treats charging as an integrated part of the manufacturing system.% - Our Proposal: A Digital Twin framework for reconfigurable charging systems.% - Contribution and Paper Structure.\section{Literature Review}% - EV charging optimization (public charging, V2G).% - Digital Twins in manufacturing.% - Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS).% - AGV/fleet management in logistics.\section{The Digital Twin Framework}\subsection{System Architecture}% - High-level diagram of the closed-loop system (Figure 1).% - Physical System: Manufacturing plant, EV fleet, reconfigurable charging station.% - Digital Twin: Simulation model, state database.% - Control System: Optimization engine, decision-making logic.\subsection{Digital Twin Model}% - Discrete-event simulation (SimPy).% - Modeling the EV Fleet (battery dynamics, task execution).% - Modeling the Manufacturing Environment (layout, task generation).% - Modeling the Reconfigurable Charging Station (modular ports, power allocation).\subsection{Optimization-Based Control}% - Mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem.% - Objective Function: Minimize(Energy Cost + Vehicle Downtime Cost).% - Constraints:%   - EV battery state of charge (SoC) limits.%   - Charging station power limits.%   - Task completion requirements.%   - Grid power constraints.% - Rolling horizon implementation.\section{Experimental Setup}\subsection{Simulation Parameters}% - Description of the simulated manufacturing facility (layout, number of machines).% - Vehicle specifications (Table 1: battery capacity, charging rate, etc.).% - Workload generation (task arrival rate).% - Electricity price data (source, e.g., CAISO).\subsection{Baseline Scenarios}% - Description of the benchmark algorithms for comparison.% - Baseline 1: Uncontrolled Charging (charge when SoC < 20%).% - Baseline 2: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).\section{Results and Discussion}% - Performance Metrics: Total Energy Cost, Average Vehicle Uptime, Charging Station Utilization.% - Figure 2: Comparison of total energy cost for all methods.% - Figure 3: Comparison of average vehicle uptime.% - Figure 4: Hourly power profile of the charging station under different controllers.% - Table 2: Detailed summary of performance metrics.% - Discussion of the results, trade-offs, and implications.% - Sensitivity Analysis (e.g., varying number of vehicles, electricity price volatility).\section{Conclusion}% - Summary of the work and key findings.% - Contribution to the field of manufacturing systems.% - Limitations and directions for future research.\bibliographystyle{plain}\bibliography{references} % Assuming a references.bib file\end{document}
